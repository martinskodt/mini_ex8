## [Program](https://rawgit.com/martinskodt/mini_ex8/master/mini_ex8/index.html)

This program is a modified version of the Daniel Shiffman video [Coding challenge #52: Random Walker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l__fEY1xanY). 
I have copied the code and changed the color, and the interaction when the point hits the edge of the program. Including changing a few values.
Specifically, I added shifting colors based on Sinus, Cosines and Tangents on line 13. And added the functionality, of the point appearing on the opposed side of the canvas, if the point hits the edge. On line 34-45.
### Difficulties 
In making a flowchart you must deconstruct your program, or a problem in another way than you do with code. It’s like learning new syntax. The boxes have specific meaning and you should follow that for the reader to have it make sense. So you have to decide how specific and detailed you want the flowchart to be. Also, that the flowchart doesn’t necessarily, follow the exact same logic and progression as the code.  
Besides that, knowing how much change is necessary to fill my own criteria of “new syntax”. Because I want to make something I can be proud of. But also, something that can be easily flowcharted. 
### Communication with Flowcharts
We must be able to show the logic to people that doesn’t know syntax. So you have to take code out of the program and only describe the logic and the process. It can be a help in a bigger program with multiple programmers to have a clear understanding of what the program does, from beginning to end. Flowchart are an universal language that all programmers can follow and code too.
